# 3-centers-algorithm
Here is one of the projects I completed in undergrad, the 3 centers algorithm using OpenMP in C. In this project, I was tasked with taking a standard serial implementation
of the 3 centers algorithm, where the objective of the problem is to choose three center points c1, c2, c3 from the list of n given points so that the maximum 
distance between any point and its closest center is minimized. 

The .dat files contain points that represent a list of city coordinates, and are used in the testing of the algorithm in order to locate the centers for each list. 

The project included testing for timing and performance, as well as a performance write-up and elaboration upon the conclusion of the project.
